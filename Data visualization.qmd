## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
dvst <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vsbuffalo/bds-files/master/chapter-08-r/Dataset_S1.txt") %>% 
  mutate(diversity = Pi / (10*1000), cent = (start >= 25800000 & end <= 29700000)) %>% 
  rename(percent.GC = `%GC`, total.SNPs = `total SNPs`, total.Bases = `total Bases`, reference.Bases = `reference Bases`)
```

```{r}
dvst <- mutate(dvst, position = (end + start) / 2)
ggplot(data = dvst) + geom_point(mapping=aes(x=position, y=diversity, colour=cent))

#centromere is repetitive DNA so we do not really know back #during this paper, not deep enough as the data is very fuzzy

```
